This is a Tetris game written in JavaScript and WebGL. 

It has all the requirement features in the assignment instruction. Plus a score feature helping user record the score of the game, which is reset to zero when start or restart the game; also some text informing the states of the game.

I watched some online tutorial when learning WebGL, basically includes StackOverflow and the following sites:
